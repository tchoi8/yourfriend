<Your friend, correspondence and collaboration> at Gallery Factory in Seoul was the first opportunity to give form and bring to surface, all the correspondence and collaboration that goes behind the scene of my artistic, curatorial and educational practice.   


At the core of the exhibition were five workshops where we created uncommon social situations for new conversation and collaboration, Crowdpilot blind date with Lauren McCarthy, Uncertainty school with Fabcoop, In Search of Personalized Time with E Roon Kang and Spam Lunch, Spam Mail with David Horvitz. The exhibition also presented 30+ drawings and artifacts by the participating artists like Christine Sun Kim and myself. I created new works for the exhibition 'Furniture for all occasions' with Ikkyun Shin and various ink drawings on paper. We decided to extend the exhibition until the end of March, all of the work is currently on display at the Gallery Factory.    


The exhibition <Your friend, correspondence and collaboration> was made without a fixed budget. There were real costs involved with shipping, producing, renting, cooking, facilitating, travel that went under my own expenses. However, most importantly, all of the works in the exhibition was realized as a gift from the participating artists and the gallery factory.  


I am starting a fundraising campaign to produce a limited edition artist book that will complete the project and also open up ways in which the project can live beyond my direct involvement.  From the project's inception and planning, I made a decision to not depend on grant or spend time for crowd funding, instead imagine ways of other ways gifting and collecting that will support the artists and the project.
 
Condtions will be appllied to all gifts 

2. Gifting to the project without an explicit expectation of future rewards. This is an opportunity to contribute to the project's continued existence.   
3. Gifting the art works to yourself and friends. I have a catalogue of available works that are priced moderately specially for the fundraising campaign. This is similar to the traditional modes of sales and collection, except all the works will come in gift package and agreement with the artists about the restrictions of resale.   
  
3. Sharing the art work as a cooperative collection. All of the works are available to be collected by a group of people, which comes with an agreement with the artists about the nature of collection and the process in which the work's ownership can be passed on in the future. 

The immediate goal is to raise $3000 to produce limited edition artist book about the workshops that happened during the exhibition. The artist book will be a pair of small pamphlets, each containing parts of the conversation that happened in the workshop. The presale begins today for $40. We will mail one part of the book to you and the other part to your friend. Your conversation with them will complete the book. The fund will also realize special publication of Sharing Faces by Kyle McDonald which has not been created yet.  

It should go with clear mention that exhibition and performance between February and March of 2015 in Seoul was realized primarily because of the opportunity that the Gallery Factory has gifted.  Gift, in this case, was an invitation for presenting work and to stage collaboration.
